## Getting tasks

You can list tasks by making a GET request to:

* `/api/tasks` for a list of all task from all projects
* `/api/tasks?where=client_id=[CLIENT_ID]` for a list of tasks from a client
* `/api/tasks?where=project_id=[PROJECT_ID]` for a list of tasks from a project
* `/api/tasks?where=tasklist_id=[TASKLIST_ID]` for a list of tasks from a task list
* `/api/tasks?where=complete=false and project_id=[PROJECT_ID]` for a list of incomplete tasks from a project 
* `/api/tasks?where=users=[USER_ID]` for a list tasks assigned to a user 
* `/api/tasks?where=users in ([USER1_ID],[USER2_ID])` for a list tasks assigned to USER1 or USER2 
* `/api/tasks?where=users=anyone` for a list tasks that have no users assigned 
* `/api/tasks?where=users in ("anyone",[USER1_ID])` for a list tasks that have no users assigned or are assigned to USER1 
* `/api/tasks?where=users<>anyone` for a list tasks that have some user assigned  
* `/api/tasks?where=mytasks=true` for a list of "My Tasks", those are tasks assigned to the user making the request, or tasks not assigned to any specific user, tasks being limited only to the projects the user is assigned to.

<a name="get"></a>
## Getting a task 

To get the task info, make a GET request to:

* `/api/tasks/[TASK_ID]`
* `/api/tasks/[TASK_ID]?include=thread.comments` for task info with a list of comments to it
* `/api/tasks/[TASK_ID]?include=files` for task info with a list of attached files

Example response:

```json
{
   "tasks": [      
      {
         "id": 2158,
         "name": "Design",
         "code": "PD-12",

      }
   ]
}
```

<a name="create"></a>
## Creating a task

To create a task, make a POST request to:

* `/api/tasks`

with the request body containing the new task info, as in the example below:

```json 
{
  "name": "Logo Design",
  "description": "Please read the emails",
  "tasklist_id": 546,
  "users": [ 204 ]
}
```

If successful, the response will return `201 Created`. The response header `Location` will contain a link for the new task. The response body will contain the new task info as in the **Getting a task** section.

When `project_id` is provided and `tasklist_id` is not, the task will be added to the `Default Task List`. In case there is no task list named `Default Task List`, such a task list will be created.

### Required fields

When creating a task: `name`, `tasklist_id` or `project_id`

<a name="update"></a>
## Updating a task

To update an existing task, make a POST or PUT request to:

* `/api/tasks/[TASK_ID]`

with the request body containing the updated info. You can send only the changed fields.

Example of request body if you want to change the task name:

```json
{
    "name": "Changes to logo"
}
```

The response will return `200 OK` and will contain the updated task info as in the **Getting a task** section.

<a name="update-tasks-order"></a>
## Changing the order of tasks

To reorder the tasks in a task list you need to make an **[update task list](tasklists.md#update-tasks-order)** request with a body similar to:

```json
{
    "tasks_order": [ 39, 2, 10, 9, 11, 12, 209 ]
}
```

where `tasks_order` is a list of task ids (from the task list) in the new order. 

You can change the order of a subset of tasks by sending only the list of task ids that changed their position.

<a name="add-file"></a>
## Adding a file to a task

To add a file to a task, make a POST request to:

* `/api/tasks/[TASK_ID]`

The request content-type should be `multipart-form-data` and the file field name equal to `file`. Here's an example using `curl` command line:

```shell
curl -u email:password
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
  -F "file=@screenshot.png"
  https://app.paymoapp.com/api/tasks/12345
```

The file can also be added when creating the task. In that case, all the task fields should be send in `multipart-form-data` format together with the file.

<a name="status"></a>
## Changing task workflow status

To change task's status, make an update request with the following request body:

```json
{
   "status_id": WORKFLOW_STATUS_ID
}
```

The list of available task statuses can be obtained from the project workflow.

**NOTE** When a task is marked as completed, the task workflow status is changed to "Complete" and when it is activated, the task workflow status is changed to "Backlog".

<a name="priority"></a>
## Changing task priority

To change task's priority, make an update request with the following request body:

```json
{
   "priority": TASK_PRIORITY
}
```

Allowed task priorities: 100, 75, 50, 25.
* 100 - Critical
* 75 - High
* 50 - Normal
* 25 - Low

**NOTE** All tasks are created with Normal (50) priority if not specified otherwise

<a name="delete"></a>
## Deleting a task 

To delete a task, make a DELETE request to:

* `/api/tasks/[TASK_ID]`

If successful, the response will have a `200 OK` status code.

### Warning

**Deleting a task will also delete all time entries logged for that task!**

<a name="billing"></a>
## Task billing

Tasks from billable projects (flat rate projects and time & materials projects) can be:
* time based
* flat rate
* non-billable

### Time based tasks

Defining fields for time based tasks:
* `billable` will be `true`
* `flat_billing` will be `false`
* `price_per_hour` will be the task hourly rate. See project's [`hourly_billing_mode`](projects.md#billing) for how the actual hourly rate is selected.

Example request to create a time based task:

* POST `/api/tasks` with the body:

```json
{
    "name": "Time based task",
    "billable": true,
    "flat_billing": false,
    "price_per_hour": 50.00,
    "tasklist_id": 1234
}
```

### Flat rate tasks

Defining fields for time based tasks:
* `billable` will be `true`
* `flat_billing` will be `true`
* `estimated_price` will be the task flat rate

Example request to create a flat rate task:

* POST `/api/tasks` with the body:

```json
{
    "name": "Flat rate task",
    "billable": true,
    "flat_billing": true,
    "estimated_price": 100.00,
    "tasklist_id": 1234
}
```
